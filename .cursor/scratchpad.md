# Stock Details Overlay Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation
- The application needs a reusable stock details overlay component
- This overlay should appear when a user clicks on any stock across different pages
- The solution should be maintainable and consistent across the entire application

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **State Management**: Need to manage which stock is currently selected and its visibility
2. **Data Flow**: Efficiently pass stock data to the overlay
3. **UI/UX**: Create a non-intrusive overlay that works well on all screen sizes
4. **Performance**: Ensure the overlay doesn't cause unnecessary re-renders
5. **Accessibility**: Make sure the overlay is keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly

## High-level Task Breakdown

### 1. Create StockDetailsOverlay Component
- Create a reusable modal/overlay component
- Include basic stock information display area
- Add close button and backdrop click handling
- Implement smooth animations

### 2. Implement State Management
- Create a context to manage the overlay state
- Include selected stock data and visibility state
- Provide methods to show/hide the overlay

### 3. Integration Points
- Wrap the app with the context provider
- Add click handlers to stock items across different pages
- Pass necessary stock data to the overlay

### 4. Styling and Theming
- Ensure the overlay matches the app's design system
- Make it responsive for different screen sizes
- Add proper z-index and scrolling behavior

### 5. Testing
- Test overlay visibility toggling
- Verify data passing works correctly
- Test on different screen sizes
- Check accessibility features

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Would you like me to start with implementing the StockDetailsOverlay component first?
- Do you have any specific UI/UX requirements for the overlay?
- Are there any existing state management libraries in use that we should consider?

## Lessons
- Keep the overlay component as dumb as possible
- Use React.memo for performance optimization
- Consider using a portal for the overlay to avoid z-index issues
- Implement proper cleanup for event listeners
